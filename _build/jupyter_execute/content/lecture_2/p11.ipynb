    "## Physics of Projectile Motion\n",
    "To model the trajectory of a projectile, we must know its x- and y- positions at any point in time. Because we want a more realistic model, we will $\\textbf{not}$ neglect air resistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The x- and y-positions* of the football at time, $t$, after it leaves Sam's hand is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = \\frac{v_x^0 v_t}{g} \\left(1 - \\textrm{exp}\\left(\\frac{-gt}{v_t}\\right)\\right)$$\n",
    "$$y = \\frac{v_t}{g}(v_y^0 + v_t)\\left(1 - \\textrm{exp}\\left(\\frac{-gt}{v_t}\\right)\\right) - v_tt$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $exp(\\alpha)$ is the natural exponential function $e^\\alpha$, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $v_x^0$, $v_y^0$ are the initial x- and y-components of velocity, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "$v_t$ is the terminal velocity (i.e., the velocity at which the drag force balances the gravitational force for a falling object).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v_t = mg/c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $m$ is the mass of the object, and $c$ is a positive constant that represents the effect of the drag force.\n",

    "*If you would like to see the derivations of these equations, please see the attached pdf.\n",

    "## Model Parameters\n",
    "To make our already-complicated lives easier, we will use SI units for this problem.\n",
