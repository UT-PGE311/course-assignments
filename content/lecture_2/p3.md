# Problem 2.3

Write a Python script that completes the following:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)	Create a random $3\times4$ NumPy array ```A```, a random $4\times1$ column vector ```b```, and a random scalar ```c```. (In all of them the random numbers should be between -3 and 3)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)	Replace the 2nd row of matrix ```A``` by the elements of vector ```b```.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)	Combine matrix ```A``` and vector ```b``` and create a combination matrix ```B``` in which the first three rows are the same as matrix ```A``` and the fourth row is composed of the elements of vector ```b```.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d)	Create another $4\times4$ matrix ```C``` with random numbers between -4 and 4.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e)	Calculate matrix ```D``` which is element by element division of ```B``` divided by ```C```.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f)	Using the ```np.reshape()``` command, make matrix ```D``` a new matrix ```E``` which has 8 rows and 2 columns.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g)	Raise each element of vector ```b``` to the power of ```c``` (the random scalar created in part a) and store the results in new vector ```e```.
