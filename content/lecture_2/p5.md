# Problem 2.5

Write a Python script to perform the following:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a)	Create a NumPy array, ```C```, which is a $10\times10$ matrix of random numbers between -1 and 1

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b)	Create a new vector, ```b```, which contains elements of the third column of ```C```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c)	Create a vector, ```d```, from $0$ to $\pi$ spaced by $\pi/16$. Create another vector, ```e```, which is the cosine of those values.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d)	Create a vector that starts from 0, increases by 20s, and ends at 1000.
