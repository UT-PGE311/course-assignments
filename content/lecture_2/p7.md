# Problem 2.7

The following parametric equations generate a conical helix.

$$
\begin{cases}
      x = 4t \cos(5t) \\
      y = t \sin(5t) \\
      z = t
\end{cases}
$$

Compute values of $x$, $y$, and $z$ for $t = 0$ to 6$\pi$ with $\Delta t$ = $\pi / 64$. 

Use subplot to generate a two-dimensional line plot (red solid line) of (x, y) in the top pane and a three-dimensional line plot (magenta solid line) of (x, y, z) in the bottom pane. 

Label the axes for both plots.
