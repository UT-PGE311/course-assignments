10% Quizzes and class assignments  
20% Exam 1        
20% Exam 2  
10% Project 1       
10% Project 2 

The lowest homework score and the lowest quiz will be dropped before computing the grade. The grades used in the course are D, C-, C, C+, B-, B, B+, A-, A.

## Homework
There will be approximately 8 homework assignments and each needs to be completed within a week.  
Don't forget to put your name and UTEID on all turned-in work. 
Homework is due one week after it is assigned, by the time noted on the homework assignment. 
-	If you turn the homework in within 24 hours, we will take 10% of the points off. 
-	If you turn the homework between 1 and 7 days late, we will take 20% off. 
-	Late homework cannot be submitted for credit after the solutions are posted. 

## Quizzes and in-class assignments
There will be quizzes posted (on Canvas) to check reading and viewing assignments that need to be completed before the class. 
There will be a lot of hands-on coding in class. 
**You will be often asked to complete exercises done in class and submit them on Canvas, and those are counted as quizzes.**

## Exams
There will two exams (in person, individual, paper-based) during the semester. 
- **Exam 1 is tentatively on Feb 28, 2023 (week 8 of class)**
- **Exam 2 is tentatively on Apr 11, 2023 (week 11 of class)**

## Projects
There will be two projects (tentatively due March 31, 2023 and May 1, 2023), and you will have two weeks to complete them. You will work on the projects with another randomly chosen team member, and in some cases there might be three team member all together. This is to prepare you for work with others in teams in general: in most cases, you do not choose your team member, and have to first work on communicating together. When the groups are assigned, please:
1. Meet at a mutually convenient time to get to know each other: discuss your working style (are you a good planner, or work on projects in the last minute?), and set a regular meeting time to review progress. 
2. Note that working on coding projects involves:  (1) understanding the concepts required to execute the problem, (2) some research, learning and planning, (3) coding as well as (4) using the code, writing up the results and reporting.
3. Discuss what are your individual strengths and weaknesses, roughly agree on who is working on which part of the project.
- Last-minute cramming rarely produces good results in team work, even if it might work for you as an individual.
- Be accountable and dependable, engineering project in-life in-general collapse otherwise.
4. You will be asked to reflect on how your team collaborated, and part of the grade will be whether the team was functional. The example of a dis-functional team include uneven perception of the work performed by each team member, or one team member completely missing out.

## Course Policies
**Turn in only your own work and clearly state if otherwise:**
You are welcome to study and discuss with others, but you are required turn in only your own work, different from others’. 
Just because it is easy to copy, or others do it, does not mean it is all right to do it (this especially applies to computer files and codes)! 
Even if you worked in a group, don't rob yourself of the satisfactory process of thinking through and working hard on problems yourself. 

Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: 
<span style="color:orange">“As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity.”</span> 
Should copying occur, both the student who copied work from another student and the student who gave material to be copied will both automatically receive a zero for the assignment. 
Penalty for violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University disciplinary action. 
University Honor Code which can be found at the following web address: https://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct/standardsofconduct.php

**Disputes:** You can dispute your graded homework, quiz, project or exam **within a week** of its return. For homework and quizzes, please try to resolve issues with the TA first.

**Be respectful and present:** If you are late to an in-person class, try not to interrupt the class. You are expected to turn off your phone, and not use your computer for any other purpose than solving class problems or taking notes.

**We are accessible, inclusive, and compliant:** The university is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive learning environment consistent with university policy and federal and state law. Please let me know if you experience any barriers to learning so I can work with you to ensure you have equal opportunity to participate fully in this course. If you are a student with a disability, or think you may have a disability, and need accommodations please contact Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD). Please refer to SSD’s website for contact and more information: http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/. 
If you are already registered with SSD, please deliver your Accommodation Letter to me as early as possible in the semester so we can discuss your approved accommodations and needs in this course.

**Zero tolerance for harassment:** The University’s mission is to create and maintain an educational and work environment free from all forms of sexual harassment, sexual discrimination, exploitation and intimidation in which all students, faculty, and staff can learn, work and thrive. Title IX is the federal law that prohibits sex and gender biased discrimination in education. The Department and the University of Texas at Austin has a zero tolerance policy for Title IX infractions. For more information visit   https://titleix.utexas.edu/about/ and https://titleix.utexas.edu/resources/. You may report any incidents online, in person, via phone or anonymously: please see https://titleix.utexas.edu/file-a-report/. Course instructors, teaching assistants and university staff are mandatory reporters.

**Dropping a course:** An engineering student must have the Dean's approval to add or drop a course after the fourth class day of the semester. Adds and drops are not approved after the fourth class day except for good cause. "Good cause" is interpreted to be documented evidence of an extenuating nonacademic circumstance (such as health or personal problems) that did not exist on or before the fourth class day. Applications for approval to drop a course after the 4th class day should be made through PGE Department office until the 12th day, and through the Office of Student Affairs afterwards.
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more information, see: http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop

**Feedback:** Feel free to email me or drop by my office with feedback, concerns, suggestions, etc. During this course I will be asking you to give me feedback on your learning in informal as well as formal ways. Please respond so we can create a better learning experience. You can submit anonymous feedback any time using this form:    https://goo.gl/forms/KisVow4RaTOA72Jq1

**Sharing of Course Materials is Prohibited:** No materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lecture hand-outs, videos, assessments (quizzes, exams, papers, projects, homework assignments), in-class materials, review sheets, and additional problem sets, may be shared online or with anyone outside of the class unless you have my explicit, written permission. Unauthorized sharing of materials promotes cheating. It is a violation of the University’s Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty. I am well aware of the sites used for sharing materials, and any materials found online that are associated with you, or any suspected unauthorized sharing of materials, will be reported to Student Conduct and Academic Integrity in the Office of the Dean of Students. These reports can result in sanctions, including failure in the course.  

**Class Recordings:** Class recordings are reserved only for students in this class for educational purposes and are protected under FERPA. The recordings should not be shared outside the class in any form. Violation of this restriction by a student could lead to Student Misconduct proceedings.

## University Resources for Students
_Classroom Safety and COVID-19_
COVID-19 spreads primarily from person to person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person sneezes or coughs. 
The droplets can infect people who are closer than about six feet to the infected person if the droplets land in their mouths or noses or are inhaled into their lungs.  
It may also be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.  
**_If you are experiencing symptoms, please stay home and email me that you’ll miss class.  I will happily provide you the materials so you can make up any notes/work._**

_To help preserve our in person learning environment, the university recommends the following:_
 - Adhere to university mask guidance.
 - Vaccinations are widely available, free and not billed to health insurance. The vaccine will help protect against the transmission of the virus to others and reduce serious symptoms in those who are vaccinated.
 - Proactive Community Testing remains an important part of the university’s efforts to protect our community. Tests are fast and free.
