# Problem 3.5.2

A group	of students in a land far, far away are writing a function in Python named ```computeRelPerm``` to compute the relative permeability of a rock. 

The following choices represent the first lines of the function files written by the students. 

For each of the choices, identify if it is a valid first line of a function (if they are correct in grammar), and if yes, then identify input and output variables (if any). 

If you claim that the line is not a valid first line of a function, then explain what is wrong with it.

- ```def computeRelPerm():``` 
- ```def computeRelPerm()```
- ```def computeRelPerm```
- ```def computeRelPerm\_2(Sw):```
- ```def computeRelPerm(Sw, phi):```
- ```def computeRelPerm.py(Sw):```
- ```def compute?RelPerm(Sw):```
- ```def 3computeRelPerm(Sw):```
- ```def !computeRelPerm(Sw):```
- ```def -computeRelPerm(Sw):```
- ```def _computeRelPerm(Sw):``` 
- ```RelPerm = computeRelPerm(Sw, phi):```


Hints: The easiest way to know whether a program/code works is to run it.
