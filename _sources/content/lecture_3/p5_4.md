# Problem 3.5.4

*Piecewise functions* are sometimes useful when the relationship between a dependent and an independent variable cannot be adequately represented by a single equation. For example, the cross section of a pipeline with a lot of scale at its bottom is described by


$$
x(\theta) = \left\lbrace
\begin{split}
8 \sin(\theta), & & -\frac{2}{3}\pi < \theta < \frac{2}{3}\pi   \\
-4 \tan(\theta), & & else
\end{split}
\right.
$$

$$
y(\theta) = \left\lbrace
\begin{split}
8 \cos(\theta), & & -\frac{2}{3}\pi < \theta < \frac{2}{3}\pi   \\
-4, & & else
\end{split}
\right.
$$

where $\theta$ is the polar angle and $\theta \in [-\pi,\pi)$.

Write a Python function to implement this piecewise function. Then write a Python script to plot the section of the pipeline.
