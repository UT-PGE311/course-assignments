# Problem 3.5.1

Write a function, called ```matrix_op``` that when sent ANY two matrices (```A```, ```B```).

It outputs three other matrices (```AT```, ```BT```and ```C```) and one scalar (```ErrorCode```)

 - ```AT``` and ```BT``` are transpose of matrix ```A``` and ```B``` 
 - ```C``` is the multiplication of ```A``` and ```B```. 
 - If multiplication of ```A``` and ```B``` is allowed, ```ErrorCode``` is 1 and when it is not allowed, ```Errorcode``` is -1 and ```C``` equals to zero.
You must use loop(s) to perform the operation and cannot use any built in commands (like A@B or A.T). 

Call your function given the following matrices ```A``` and ```B```.

Print out your function file and results.

$$A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 3 \\
                1 & -2 \\
                5 & -3 \end{bmatrix} $$

and 

$$B = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & -5 & 0\\
                        2 & 3 & 2 \end{bmatrix} $$
