# Problem 3.4.4

The "divide and average" method, an old-time method for approximating the square root of any positive number $a$, can be formulated as

$$x_{new} = \frac{x_{old} + a/x_{old}}{2}$$

Implement this algorithm with while...break loop in Python. 

This formula means we need to initialize ```x``` with a value. 
After that, at every step, we create a new value of ```x``` which is called ```x_new``` with the expression on the right hand side.

At each step estimate the error in your approximation as
$\epsilon = ||\frac{x_{new} −x_{old}}{x_{new}}||$

Repeat the loop until $\epsilon$ is less than or equal to a specified value (you pick).
Design your program (function) so that it returns both the result and the error. 

Make sure that it can evaluate the square root of numbers that are equal to and less than zero. For the latter case, display the result as an imaginary number. 
For example, the square root of $-4$ would return $2i$. 

Test your program by evaluating a = 0, 9 and -25 for $\epsilon$=1E−4. Use ```x=1``` as the initial input.

**Notes**: If you want to verify your results, you may use ```numpy.sqrt()``` function.
