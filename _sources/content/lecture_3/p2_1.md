# Problem 3.2.1

Develop a function that is passed a numeric grade from 0 to 100 and returns a letter grade according to the scheme shown below.


| Letter |       Criteria       |
|--------|:--------------------:|
| A      | $90 \leq x \leq 100$ |
| B      |   $80 \leq x < 90$   |
| C      |   $70 \leq x < 80$   |
| D      |   $60 \leq x < 70$   |
| E      |      $ x < 60 $      |



Design the function so that it displays an error message and terminates in the event that the user 
enters a value of score that is less than zero or greater than 100. 

Test your function with 89.9999, 90, 45, -17, and 120.
