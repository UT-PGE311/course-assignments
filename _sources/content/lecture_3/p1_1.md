# Problem 3.1.1

Manningâ€™s equation can be used to compute the velocity of water in a rectangular open channel:

$$ U = \frac{\sqrt{S}}{n} \left(\frac{BH}{B+2H}\right)^{2/3}, $$

where $U$=velocity(m/s), $S$=channel slope, $n$=roughness coefficient, $B$=width (m), and $H$=depth (m).



Read in the attached channel.csv file. Each column represents a parameter in the above equation and each row represents a different channel.
Compute the velocity for each of these channels. Append a column to the channel.csv data and write it out.
