# Problem 3.4.2

Create a function to compute $f(x) = e^x$ at any given point using Taylor series. 

First, write a function called ```compute_factorial(n)``` that returns the factorial ```n```.

Then, write a function called ```taylor_series()``` to do the following:

 - Set the starting point as ```x0 = 1``` & ```f0 = f(x0) = 2.718282```
 - Ask the user to enter his/her desired point and store it in ```x1```
 - Calculate the true solution for $f(x1)$ and store it in ```f1_true```
 - Calculate the first term of Taylor series at ```x1``` and store it in ```f1_taylor```
 - Calculate the true relative error of ```f1_taylor``` and store it in ```true_error```
 - Use while loop and calculate next terms of Taylor formulation until the true relative error is less than $5%$.
    - Once the next term is calculated, it should be added to the current value of ```f1_taylor``` and ```true_error``` should be updated.
    - Print the values of ```f1_taylor``` and ```true_error``` after each calculation 
    - Count the number of Taylor formulation terms and print them
 
Run your program twice:
    1. For $x1 = 1.5$ (you can compare the results of this case with Question #2) 
    2. For one other $x1$ value of your choice.
