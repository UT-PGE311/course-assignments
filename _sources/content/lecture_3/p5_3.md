# Problem 3.5.3

The temperature dependence of chemical reactions can be computed with the Arrhenius equation:

$$
k=Ae^{-E/(RT_a)}
$$

where $k$ = reaction rate (s$^-1$), $A$ = the preexponential (or frequency) factor, $E$ = activation energy (J/mol), $R$ = gas constant [8.314 J/(mole$\cdot$K)], and $T_a$ = absolute temperature (K). 

Write a Python function that takes $E$, $A$, and temperature $Ta$ as input and returns the reaction rate computed by the Arrhenius equation.

A compound has $E = 1\times 10^5$ J/mol and $A=7\times 10^{16}$. Use your function to calculate the reaction rates of this compound for temperature ranging from 253 to 325 K. Use subplot to generate a side-by-side graph of the following curves. Include axis labels and titles for both subplots. 

- $k$ versus $T_a$ (green line)
- $\log_{10}{k}$ (red line) versus $1/T_a$.
