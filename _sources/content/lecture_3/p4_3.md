# Problem 3.4.3

The sine function can be evaluated by the following infinite series:

$$sin(x) = x - \frac{x^3}{3!} - \frac{x^5}{5!} ...$$

Create a script to implement this formula so that it computes and displays the values
of $sin(x)$ as each term in the series is added. In other words, compute and display in sequence the values for

$$sin(x) = x$$

$$sin(x) = x − \frac{x^3}{3!}$$

$$sin(x)= x - \frac{x^3}{3!} - \frac{x^5}{5!}$$

$$\vdots$$

up to the order term of your choosing.


For each of the preceding, compute and display the percent relative error as
$ %error = \frac{true−series approximation}{true} * 100%$

As a test case, employ the program to compute sin(0.9) for up to and including eight terms - that is, up to the term $\frac{x^{15}}{15!}$.
