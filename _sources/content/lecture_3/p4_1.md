# Problem 3.4.1

Write a function called ```find_factorials()``` to do the following:
- Ask the user to input two integers (i , j)
- Find all integers which $n!$ is between $i , j$ and put them in a vector called ```fact```.

Your script can have just one loop, try not to use predefined functions factorial functions

Run your script for ```j= 123456``` and ```i=2345``` and print the result.
