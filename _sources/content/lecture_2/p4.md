# Problem 2.4

If a force F (N) is applied to compress a spring, its displacement x (m) can often be modeled by Hookeâ€™s law:
$$F = k x$$

where $k$ = the spring constant (N/m). The potential energy stored in the spring $U$ (J) can then be computed as

$$U =  1/2 kx^2$$

Five springs are tested and the following data compiled:
$$F = \begin{bmatrix}14 & 18 & 8 & 9 & 13\end{bmatrix}     \text{(N)}$$
$$x = \begin{bmatrix}0.013 & 0.020 & 0.009 & 0.010 & 0.012\end{bmatrix}      \text{(m)}$$

Write a Python script to store $F$ and $x$ as vectors and then compute vectors of the spring constants $k$ and the potential energies $U$. 

Then, determine the maximum potential energy.
