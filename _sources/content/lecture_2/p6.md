# Problem 2.6

It turns out that, there is a mathematical formula for expressing your love of coding.

Plot the heart shown in the figure below in Python using:

Solid line in red color for the top portion of the graph. The mathematical formula for that function is:

$$y=\sqrt{1 - (|x|-1)^2}$$

Dashed line in blue color for the lower portion of the graph. The mathematical formula for that function is:

$$y=-3\sqrt{1 - \sqrt{0.5|x|}}$$

Make sure to set the axes' limits, title and grid as shown. Also make the axes proportional.
