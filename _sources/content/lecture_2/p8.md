# Problem 2.8

The temperature dependence of chemical reactions can be computed with the Arrhenius equation:

$$k=Ae^{(-E/(RT_a))}$$

where $k$ = reaction rate (s-1), $A$ = the preexponential (or frequency) factor, $E$ =
activation energy (J/mol), $R$ = gas constant [8.314 J/(mole-K)], and $T_a$ = absolute
temperature (K). 

A compound has $E = 1\times10^5 J/mol$ and $A = 7\times10^16$. 

Use Python to generate values of reaction rates for temperature ranging from 253 to 325 K. Use
subplot to generate a side-by-side graph of the following curves. Include axis labels and titles for both subplots.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) $k$ vs. $T_a$ (green line)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) $\log_{10} k$ vs. $1/T_a$ (red line).
